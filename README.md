# Child-Embodiment

This project pits an avatar (either child or Lego character) in front of a mirror.

The avatar is animated through the VRIK component from the FinalIK package. The Lego assets are from a collaboration with Unity in which a sample project was released, also found on the Unity Asset store. Finally, a waiting room contains a panorama image projected onto the skybox.
